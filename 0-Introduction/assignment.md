# Get Up and Running

## Instructions

In this non-graded assignment, you should brush up on Python and get your environment up and running and able to run notebooks.

### 1. Follow the setup instructions

Follow the instructions in the [setup guide](../README.md#setup) to get your environment ready for the course.

### 3. Test your environment

To test that your environment is set up correctly, open the `0-Introduction/notebook.ipynb` notebook and run through the cells. If you can run all the cells without errors, you're good to go!
