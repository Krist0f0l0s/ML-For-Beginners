# Machine Learning for Beginners - A Curriculum

> 🌍 Travel around the world as we explore Machine Learning by means of world cultures 🌍

Cloud Advocates at Microsoft are pleased to offer a 12-week, 26-lesson curriculum all about **Machine Learning**. In this curriculum, you will learn about what is sometimes called **classic machine learning**, using primarily Scikit-learn as a library and avoiding deep learning, which is covered in our [AI for Beginners' curriculum](https://aka.ms/ai4beginners). Pair these lessons with our ['Data Science for Beginners' curriculum](https://aka.ms/ds4beginners), as well!

Travel with us around the world as we apply these classic techniques to data from many areas of the world. Each lesson includes pre- and post-lesson quizzes, written instructions to complete the lesson, a solution, an assignment, and more. Our project-based pedagogy allows you to learn while building, a proven way for new skills to 'stick'.

# Getting Started
